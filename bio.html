        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Let's start at the beginning. I was born August 17th, 1986 in Miami, FL.
          I spent the earliest years of my life on the beach and in the ocean fishing with family and friends.
           After graduating from St. Thomas Aquinas HS in 2004, I enrolled at the University of Florida (no more beaches!).
           I began working shortly thereafter and fast-forward to today, I am working on another career change.
           I have always held a curiosity for web development and have been challenging myself to learn new coding languages
           that can be applied to a career in web development. My journey at Red Ventures began in Sales, and I am excited to
           have the opportunity to take on a new challenge within this organziation. My wife, Ronda, has been extremely
           supportive and is as passionate as I am in learning to create on the web.
           Reach out to me on the contact form above to send suggestions on what language/library I should learn next!</p>
